        "Recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "✔ Apply fairness constraints (equalized odds / demographic parity) using Fairlearn mitigation.\n",
        "✔ Remove or limit sensitive leakage features (occupation, marital-status patterns).\n",
        "✔ Re-sample the dataset to balance gender distribution.\n",
        "✔ Consider fairness-aware algorithms (e.g., adversarial debiasing).\n",
        "✔ Continuously monitor fairness metrics during deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        " Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This project demonstrates the importance of combining predictive performance with fairness and explainability.\n",
        "While Logistic Regression performs well overall, fairness metrics reveal gender bias, and explainability tools (SHAP + LIME) confirm that both gender and gender-correlated features influence predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improving this model requires incorporating fairness constraints, revisiting preprocessing decisions, and continuously evaluating ethical impacts to ensure an equitable AI system."
